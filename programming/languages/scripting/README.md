A **scripting** or **script language** is a [programming language](https://github.com/shekhar-infinity/learn/blob/develop/programming/languages/README.md) that supports scripts: programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.
Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled).
